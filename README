To run the program open cmake-build-debug in terminal and write ./event_manager
The solution works with a CSV file located in cmake-build-debug, whose name you are asked to provide when you start the application.
If you don't provide a name, the default file input will be used.
If you enter a non-existent file, an empty file will be created for you.
After this, a menu will appear with available options.
To use it enter integer 1-5(Don't try to enter something else ;))
